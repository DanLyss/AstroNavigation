Running a Unix-Only Library on a Mobile App

Overview 🛠️

Our mobile application requires a library that is only available on Unix-based systems (astrometry). Since mobile devices run different operating system (Android), we need a strategy to integrate this library efficiently.

Possible Solutions 🚀

1. Using a Compatibility Layer 🏗️

If the library is written in C/C++, we can use tools like Cygwin or WSL for Windows or cross-compilation for Android (NDK).

For iOS, we may need jailbroken environments or an equivalent POSIX-compliant layer.

3. Running a Unix Subsystem on Mobile 📲
	Use Termux or a chrooted Linux environment to execute the Unix library.

4. Cross-Compiling the Library 🔄

Modify and compile the Unix library using Android NDK 

This approach ensures local execution without network dependency.

Recommended Approach ✅

For the best balance of performance and maintainability, we most likely Cross-compile the library using the NDK.
