# Overwiew of gyroscope research 📖

Since the [Research](https://github.com/DanLyss/AstroNavigation/blob/main/artifacts/Gyroscope_Presicion_Research.pdf) itself is quite hard to read we want to highlight main parts of it that were really helpful reducing overlall uncertainty level. Basically **table 3** and **table 5** in that paper tell us about the standart deviation and random noise resistance respectively. By combining this data it can be seen that the overlall error of gyroscope readings is low enough for our purposes.
