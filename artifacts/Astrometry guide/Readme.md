# 🌌 Astrometry Installation & Usage Guide

📂 This folder contains a full step-by-step [**guide**](guide.md) on Astrometry installation and usage.

📸 There are also **2 photos** available to perform the sky analysis yourself:
- [📷 Photo 1](photo_2023-08-17_00-00-37.jpg)
- [📷 Photo 2](photo_2024-08-27_22-47-37.jpg)

✅ If everything works correctly, following the instructions in the guide and finally running the [**script**](astrosolver.py), you will obtain a **`*-ngc.png`** file, containing:
- A **marked sky** with recognized stars.
- Printed **recognized stars' coordinates** on the image.
- Their **spherical coordinates**.

⚠️ **Troubleshooting:**
If, for some reason, you didn't manage to install Astrometry, you can find the results already obtained by [me](https://github.com/DanLyss):
